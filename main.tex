\cvsection[page2sidebar]{Project Experience }
\cvachievement{\faServer}{Customer-facing high load application.}{ Due to the nature of the product and its stage of development, I am unable to disclose details. This project is built on Kubernetes with a microservice architecture and SQS as a message broker for asynchronous processing. This was the first of its kind, and so we were a platform for accessing feasibility and effectiveness of Kubernetes as a solution. We built everything from the ground up, from the developer tools, monitoring stack to the customer provisioning. This product is in its early adopter phase, to be released to the general public in the coming months.}

\cvachievement{\faGamepad}{Educational Minecraft platform.}{ At Play Well for Life, we developed a product which aimed to use Minecraft as an educational platform. In order to cope with scale, I designed it around containerised servers using ECS. These containers were only accessible through a BungeeCord Proxy Server which authenticated and redirected players to their servers. I also created a website using bubble.io that was the platform to rent a server that would provision a server for new customer on purchase and allow them to add a list of allowed Minecraft Users to join. }
