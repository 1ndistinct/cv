\textbf{Overview}

I have been given a team to lead following the successful launch of the Cloud Security product. My team goals are to further Research and Development within the Cloud Security space outside of the core product offering. This means identifying capabilities the product is lacking, understanding the requirements, designing and building these features to improve the product offering. This includes working with stakeholders across departments. Product to identify missing features. UX to design workflows for these features. UI to integrate with the backend and DevOps to get required pipelines and infrastructure in place.   
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Working closely with UX to standardise workflows and improve useability in the existing product with an aim to bring more useful insights and finding to the user in a more digestable and consistent way.
  \item Working closely with UI to build data frameworks around UI components in order to standardise how data is served for quick iteration in the future. 
  \item Working closely with engineering leads to standardise processes and functionality across the product suite to create a more seamless experience.
  \item Architect, build and deploy all facets of production applications on Kubernetes to serve new product services.
  \item Manage priorities, assign tasks and deadlines to team members and all other clerical work associated with management
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Overview}

Started on existing offerings within the SaaS space. Wrote the first line and much of the application code on the core Cloud Security product offering for AWS. Took it to market with a team that grew to 11 engineers while managing the production cycles, production debugging, client calls and supporting teams across DevOps, Support, Product Development and Internal Development to ensure smooth operation during release.
\newline
\newline
Moved from working on a monolithic based architecture to a containerised microservice architecture. In doing so we built standards within Darktrace for further microservice development. Ranging from fault tolerance, scaling, resilience, security, development CI/CD and customer provisioning and deployment pipelines.

\divider
\textbf{Responsibilities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Architect, build and deploy microservices on Kubernetes to serve the backend of the product offering.
\item Build authentication mechanisms to ensure customer data separation in production environments.
\item Build customer provisioning pipelines.
\item Help solidify company microservice development best practices within Darktrace.
\item Manage production release cycles.
\item Talk with customers to help deploy the product and debug issues.
\end{itemize}
